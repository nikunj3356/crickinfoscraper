# ICC Cricket World Cup Statistics
• Implemented Web Scrapping in Javascript using Node.js to fetch the statistics of every player who played in the ICC Cricket World Cup <br/>
• Used Cheerio to parse the HTML and remove all the DOM inconsistencies and browser cruft from the jQuery library <br/>
• Used File-System (fs) module to create separate directories in the system memory for each country and save the statistics of every player in separate Excel files <br/>
